	 * In this function, we will create a bunch of images.  Images in graphics serve essentially two purposes.  One
	 * is to provide data to shaders, traditionally known as textures.  Another is to render into either as the
	 * final result or for further use, traditionally also known as textures.  Vulkan calls all of these "images",
	 * which are just glorified "buffers".  We already worked with a Vulkan buffer in Tutorial 4, which was just an
	 * array of data.  Images on the other hand can have up to 3 dimensions, a format (such as BGRA), multisampling
	 * properties, tiling properties and a layout.  They are glorified buffers because all of these features can be
	 * emulated with buffers, although besides requiring more work in the shaders, using images also allows a lot
	 * more optimization by the device and its driver.
	 *
	 * That said, creating images is fairly similar to buffers.  You create an image, allocate memory to it, create
	 * an image view for access to the image, you bind it to a command buffer through a descriptor set and go on
	 * using it in the shaders.  Like buffers, you can choose to initialize the image.  The data sent through
	 * images could be anything, such as textures used to draw objects, patterns used by a shader to apply an
	 * effect, or just general data for the shaders.  The image can be written to as well.  The data written to an
	 * image could also be for anything, such as the final colors that go on to be displayed on the screen, the
	 * depth or stencil data, the output of a filter used for further processing, the processed image to be
	 * retrieved by the application (e.g. used by gimp), a texture that evolves over time, etc.
	 *
	 * Loading the image data is outside the scope of this tutorial, so we'll leave that for another time.  Once
	 * the image is created, it's device memory can be mapped, loaded and unmapped, so it is not necessary to do
	 * that in this function either.

		/*
		 * To create an image, we need a CreateInfo struct as usual.  Some parts of this struct is similar to
		 * VkBufferCreateInfo from Tutorial 3.  The ones that need explanation are explained here.  The image
		 * type specifies what are the dimensions of the image.  In these tutorial series, we will use 2D
		 * images for simplicity.  Also for simplicity, let's ignore mipmapping and image layers.  The image
		 * format is one of VK_FORMAT.  A normal format could be VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM, but it might make
		 * sense to use other formats, especially for images that would get their data from a texture file.
		 *
		 * If the image is going to be initialized, for example from a texture file, then the structure of the
		 * image data, otherwise known as "tiling", must be set to linear.  This means that the image is stored
		 * as a normal row-major array, so that when its memory is mapped by the application, it would make
		 * sense!  If the image is not to be initialized on the other hand, it is better to keep the tiling as
		 * optimal, which means whatever format the GPU likes best.  It is necessary for the application to
		 * copy a linear image to an optimal one for GPU usage.  If the application wants to read the image
		 * back, it must copy it from an optimal image to a linear one.  This also means that the `usage` of
		 * the linear images can contain only TRANSFER_SRC and TRANSFER_DST bits.  More on image copies when we
		 * actually start using them.
		 *
		 * Linear images are sampled only once.  Optimal images can be multisampled.  You can read about
		 * multisampling online (from OpenGL), but in short it asks for each pixel to be sampled at multiple
		 * locations inside the pixel, which helps with antialiasing.  Here, we will simply choose a higher
		 * number of samples as allowed by the GPU (retrieved with vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties
		 * below).
		 *
		 * Linear images are also restricted to 2D, no mipmapping and no layers, which is fortunate because we
		 * wanted those for simplicity anyway!  There is also a restriction on the format of the image, which
		 * cannot be depth/stencil.
		 *
		 * In Tutorial 3, we specified the buffer usage as storage, which was a rather generic specification.
		 * For the image, we have more options to specify the usage.  Choosing the minimum usage bits for each
		 * image, specifying only what we actually want to do with the image allows the GPU to possibly place
		 * the image in the most optimal memory location, or load/unload the image at necessary times.  This is
		 * left to the application to provide as it varies from case to case.  The usages in short are:
		 *
		 * Transfer src/dst: whether the image can be used as a source/destination of an image copy.
		 * Sampled: whether the image can be sampled by a shader.
		 * Storage: whether the image can be read from and written to by a shader.
		 * Color attachment: whether the image can be used as a render target (for color).
		 * Depth/stencil attachment: whether the image can be used as a render target (for depth/stencil).
		 * Transient attachment: whether the image is lazily allocated (ignored for now).
		 * Input attachment: whether the image can be read (unfiltered) by a shader (ignored for now).
		 *
		 * If the image was to be shared between queue families, it should be declared with a special
		 * `sharingMode` specifying that there would be concurrent access to the image, and by which queue
		 * families.  We are going to use the images and views created here in multiple pipelines, one for each
		 * swapchain image.  Since those pipelines may be created on top of different queue families, we need
		 * to tell Vulkan that these images would be shared.  At the time of this writing, on Nvidia cards
		 * there is only one queue family and sharing is meaningless.  However, it is legal for a driver to
		 * expose multiple similar queue families instead of one queue family with multiple queues.  The
		 * application is expected to provide the queue families that would use this image.  Most likely, the
		 * result of `tut7_get_presentable_queues` is what you would want.
		 *
		 * Finally, an image has a layout.  Each layout is limited in what operations can be done in it, but
		 * instead is optimal for a task.  The possible image layouts are:
		 *
		 * Undefined: no device access is allowed.  This is used as an initial layout and must be transitioned
		 *   away from before use.
		 * Preinitialized: no device access is allowed.  Similar to undefined, this is only an initial layout
		 *   and must be transitioned away from before use.  The only difference is that the contents of the
		 *   image are kept during the transition.
		 * General: supports all types of device access.
		 * Color attachment optimal: only usable with color attachment images.
		 * Depth/stencil attachment optimal: only usable with depth/stencil attachment images.
		 * Depth/stencil read-only optimal: only usable with depth/stencil attachment images.  The difference
		 *   between this and the depth/stencil attachment optimal layout is that this image can also be used
		 *   as a read-only sampled image or input attachment for use by the shaders.
		 * Shader read-only optimal: only usable with sampled and input attachment images.  Similar to
		 *   depth/stencil read-only optimal, this layout can be used as a read-only image or input attachment
		 *   for use by the shaders.
		 * Transfer src/dst optimal: only usable with transfer src/dst images and must only be used as the
		 *   source or destination of an image transfer.
		 * Present src (extension): used for presenting an image to a swapchain.  An image taken from the
		 *   swapchain is in this layout and must be transitioned away before use after
		 *   vkAcquireNextImageKHR.  Before giving the image back with vkQueuePresentKHR, it must be
		 *   transitioned again to this layout.
		 *
		 * For linear images, which are going to be initialized by the application, we will use the
		 * preinitialized layout.  Otherwise, the layout must be undefined and later transitioned to the
		 * desired layout using a pipeline barrier (more on this later).

			 * If the image is going to be sampled, we can create a sampler for it as well.  A sampler
			 * specifies how to sample an image.  An image is just a glorified buffer, i.e., it's just an
			 * array, as I have said before as well.  However, the sampler is what makes using images so
			 * much more powerful.  When accessing a buffer, you can access each index individually.  With
			 * a sampler, you can access an image at non-integer indices.  The sampler then "filters" the
			 * image to provide some data for that index.
			 *
			 * The simplest example is magnification.  If you sample the image at coordinates (u+0.5,v)
			 * where u and v are integer pixel locations, then the color you get could be the average of
			 * the colors (values) at coordinates (u,v) and (u+1,v).  Vulkan uses the term `texel` to refer
			 * to these "texture" pixels.
			 *
			 * The sampler parameters are explained below:
			 *
			 * - magFilter, minFilter: what to do if asked to sample between the texels.  The options are
			 *   to take the value of the nearest texel, or interpolate between neighbors.  Think about it
			 *   as what to do if you try to zoom in or out of an image.  We'll go with interpolation,
			 *   since it's nicer.
			 * - mipmapMode: similarly, if the image has multiple mipmap levels, accessing between the
			 *   levels could either interpolate between two levels or clamp to the nearest.  We don't use
			 *   mipmaps here, so this doesn't matter, but let's tell it to interpolate anyway.
			 * - addressModeU/V/W: this specifies what happens if you access outside the image.  The
			 *   options are to:
			 *   * repeat the image as if it was a tiled to infinity in each direction,
			 *   * mirrored repeat the image as if a larger image containing the image and its mirror
			 *     was tiled to infinity in each direction,
			 *   * clamp to edge so that any access out of the image boundaries returns the value at the
			 *     closest point on the edge of the image,
			 *   * clamp to border so that any access out of the image boundaries returns a special
			 *     "border" value for the image (border value defined below),
			 *   * mirrored clamp to edge so that any access out of the image boundaries returns the value
			 *     at the closest point on the edge of a larger image that is made up of the image and its
			 *     mirror.
			 *   Each of these modes is useful in different situations.  "Repeat" is probably the most
			 *   problematic as it introduces discontinuity around the edges.  "Mirrored" solves this
			 *   problem and can add some interesting effects.  "Clamp to edge" also solves this problem,
			 *   and let's just use that.  "Clamp to border" would introduce other edges, and I imagine is
			 *   most useful for debugging.
			 * - anisotropyEnable, maxAnisotropy: whether anisotropic filtering is enabled and by how
			 *   much.  Anisotropic filtering is expensive but nice, so let's enable it.  The maximum value
			 *   for anisotropic filtering can be retrieved from the device's limits.
			 * - compareEnable, compareOp: this is used with depth images to result in a reading of 0 or 1
			 *   based on the result of a compare operation.  We are not interested in this for now.
			 * - minLod, maxLod: the level-of-detail value (mip level) gets clamped to these values.  We
			 *   are not using mipmapped images, so we'll just give 0 and 1 respectively.
			 * - borderColor: if the "clamp to border" addressing mode was selected, out-of-bound accesses
			 *   to the image would return the border color, which is set here.  Options are limited:
			 *   transparent, white and black.  Since we're using "clamp to edge" addressing, this value is
			 *   not used.
			 * - unnormalizedCoordinates: with Vulkan, you can either index the image using the
			 *   unnormalized coordinates, so that u and v span from 0 to size of the image, or you can
			 *   access the image using normalized coordinates, so that u and v span from 0 to 1.
			 *   Unnormalized coordinates can be useful in some circumstances, but normalized coordinates
			 *   lets you access the image without dealing with its sizes.  Aside from that, with
			 *   unnormalized coordinates, you are limited in the type of images you can access; only 1D
			 *   and 2D images with a single layer and single mip level are acceptable and essentially all
			 *   other features of the sampler must be disabled too.  Needless to say, we will use
			 *   normalized coordinates.

	 * image, we will just create a view (which we already saw how to do in that function), and we will use that
	 * function to create our depth/stencil image and its view.
	 *
	 * If we wanted to render to an image, without presenting on the screen, here is where the difference would be,
	 * that is, we would be creating an image for the color attachment ourselves, instead of using one created by
	 * the swapchain.

	 * Since the render pass just defines how the attachments look like, we need only one for use with all of our
	 * swapchain images.  On the other hand, we need a different framebuffer for each swapchain image (together
	 * with its corresponding depth/stencil image).
	 *
	 * Our render pass has two attachments; the color image and the depth/stencil image.  Each of these attachments
	 * needs to be specified separately:
	 *
	 * - In the case of the color image, the format is given by `surface_format`, and in the case of the
	 *   depth/stencil image, the format is the one we just decided on above.
	 * - For now, we don't do multisampling, so the number of samples is set to 1 for both attachments.
	 * - At the beginning and end of each subpass, the render pass can either keep or clear/discard the contents of
	 *   an attachment.  We use one subpass, so this doesn't really matter, but we'll go with clearing the image at
	 *   the beginning and keeping the contents at the end.  If not specified, the default action (value 0) is to
	 *   keep the previous data at the beginning and preserve it at the end as well.
	 * - The render pass also declares a promise that the driver would find the attachment in a certain layout at
	 *   the beginning of the render pass, and that the attachment would be at a certain layout at the end.  For our
	 *   color attachment, it will start and end in the color attachment layout.  The case is similar for the
	 *   depth/stencil buffer.  We don't intend to transition them to another layout.
	 *
	 * Next, we need to declare the subpasses of the render pass.  We use only one, so this is more
	 * straightforward.  The information required here are:
	 *
	 * - pipeline bind point: whether compute or graphics pipelines are going to use this subpass.  We want
	 *   graphics now, so we'll go with that, but anyway compute is not even supported (at the time of this
	 *   writing).
	 * - Attachments: which attachments to use, and which to simply preserve.  If an attachment is neither used nor
	 *   preserved, its contents become undefined.  If the attachment is decorated with `location=X` in glsl, then
	 *   pInputAttachments[X] is used if it's an input, or pColorAttachments[X] is used if it's an output.  This is
	 *   other than the `binding=Y` decoration that specifies the buffer/image as specified by the descriptor set.
	 *   There can be multiple input and color attachments (hence the `location=X` binding required above), but
	 *   only one depth/stencil attachment.
	 *
	 * In the end, if we had multiple subpasses, their dependencies would also need to be declared.  What's nice
	 * about subpasses is that there is an automatic layout transition between subpasses (as specified by
	 * VkAttachmentReference values), and there is a whole set of rules that allow the driver to safely perform
	 * this transition before or after the subpass has actually started.  Again, we have a single subpass, so none
	 * of this matters now.
